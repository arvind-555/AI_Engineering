Day: 5 
Focus:  LISTS

Work Done:
 

Programs Added: 
1) max_min
2) find_sum
3) create_list
4) count_even_odd_num
5) remove_duplicate
6) reverse
7) search_elements
8) sorting
9) spliting a list
10) summary 
 

Understanding Level:
 - how lists and initialized and declared 
 - how to update a list 
Difficulties Faced:
- Python file showed “No such file or directory” error in VS Code terminal despite correct code.
- Folder name contained a space, which PowerShell misinterpreted during manual execution.
 
How I Resolved Them:
- Renamed folder using snake_case; IDEs handle paths automatically, terminals require exact paths.
 
Key Takeaways: 
- if you want your function to return two outputs use - 'return output1, output2'


Next Day Plan:
 


total program count = 45
