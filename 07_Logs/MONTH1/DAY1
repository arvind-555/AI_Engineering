Day: 01
Focus: Python Basics + Environment Setup

Work Done:
- Installed VS Code
- Installed Python 3.13.7
- Installed Git and connected GitHub
- Created structured workspace on D drive
- Added and executed Day 1 Python programs in VS Code
- Pushed Day 1 code to GitHub

Programs Added:
- ADD.py
- DIVISION.py
- PRODUCT.py
- SUB.py
- whole_square.py

Understanding Level:
- Basic Python syntax is clear
- print(), variables, input(), and arithmetic are understandable

Difficulties Faced:
- VS Code file vs folder confusion
- GitHub push and identity setup issues
- File extension (.py) handling initially unclear

How I Resolved Them:
- Understood difference between files and folders
- Learned Git commit–push workflow
- Verified changes using git status

Key Takeaways:
- GitHub only reflects committed changes
- Empty folders are not tracked by Git
- Proper structure matters from Day 1

Next Day Plan:
- Write fresh code directly in VS Code
- Cover variables in depth and data types
- Start maintaining notes alongside code
